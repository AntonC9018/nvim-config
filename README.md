You must install `ripgrep` manually to make telescope `live_grep` feature work.

On Windows I've used mingw64 console to install it using `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ripgrep`
but then I also had to add mingw64's bin path to the env variable `PATH`. 
At this point I might want to migrate my work to Linux though, having a package
manager and not having to deal with Windows stuff would be nice.

Install the nerd font `SauceCode` from [here](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#source-code-pro)

You need [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) for [this](https://github.com/danielfalk/smart-open.nvim).
